# Task: Refactor Stack-Based Value Operations (`vstack`/`vtop`)

## Goal
Improve the maintainability, safety, and readability of low-level `vstack` / `vtop` operations (such as `push_sym_value`, `eval_sym_to_temp`, `vpush_string`, and related expression stack manipulations in `tccgen.c`).

## Context & Pain Points
TinyCC uses an explicit virtual expression stack (`vstack`, `vtop`) for code generation. Functions like `eval_sym_to_temp`, `push_sym_value`, `vpush_string`, `do_d_assert`, and related expression routines frequently interleave low-level stack primitives:
- Manual stack manipulation: `vtop`, `vstack`, `vpop()`, `vset()`, `vpush_*()`.
- Stack reorganization and storage: `vrott()`, `vstore()`.
- Temporary variable management: `get_temp_local_var()`.
## Proposed Strategies for Maintainability
1. **Structured Expression Descriptors**:
   For complex language features (like D assert comparisons or slice operations), evaluate operands into explicit C structs/descriptors first, then emit the stack operations in a single atomic step rather than piecemeal stack pushes.
2. **GCC `__attribute__((cleanup))` & Scoped Stack Guards**:
   In C, use cleanup functions and block-scoped macros to automatically balance `vtop` or clean up temporary stack references when leaving a local scope, preventing stack leaks on early error returns.
3. **High-Level Combinators & Functional Builders**:
   Replace raw imperative pointer math (`vtop++`, `vtop--`, `vrott`) with helper combinators that manage stack boundaries and temporary local allocations safely within block scopes.
4. **Invariant Assertions & Stack Depth Tracking**:
   Add explicit stack depth checks and debug assertions (e.g., asserting expected `vtop` delta before and after expression evaluation) to catch stack imbalance at compile time.
